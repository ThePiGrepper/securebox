* Setup Module:
AT+SAPBR = 1,1
AT+HTTPINIT
AT+SAPBR = 3,1,"APN","claro"
//it makes sense and it's suggested in several places to first set the bearer params(3,1),
//and then open the bearer connection(1,1), but THIS WORKS.

* StatusCodes:(more relevant)
  200: OK
  601: Network Error

* Handle disconnection:
//to reconnect to the network, apparently this works:
AT+CIPCSGP=1,"claro"
returns "OK" //the next GET request should return 200 again, instead of 601(network error)

Another method to handle disconnection(or 602 return code) is closing and opening connection:
AT+SAPBR=0,1 //close connection
AT+SAPBR=1,1 //open connection
*This probably will bring back the connection without setting HTTPPARA(request value) again,
 nor having to restart with HTTPINIT.

* Check status:
*Apparently with this you can check the current network settings.
*Not necessarily if there's an active connection though.
*these are the return values for both commands when a network is set.
*when it's not, the first command returns: +SAPBR: 1,3,"0.0.0.0" and APN field is empty.
